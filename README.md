### A Little About Me ✨

Hey there! I’m Noorya, but you can call me Nora (no one ever gets my name right 🤷‍♀️). Coding is my passion, but I also love reading (aiming for 53 books a year!). I’m always looking for exciting projects and teams to collaborate with. Let’s create something amazing together! Feel free to reach out—I’m open to collaboration, learning, and sharing knowledge! 😊
