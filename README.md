# 👋 Hi, I'm Manija (Noorya/Nora) Wahab!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a **full-stack developer** passionate about crafting interactive, responsive web apps and diving deep into the endless world of technology. 🚀 I’m currently on a journey to explore **AI** and **machine learning** (watch this space!) and would love to be part of a team that’s equally passionate about creating awesome tech. 🌟

I code because it’s my flow state—where time disappears, and I'm completely immersed in solving problems, building projects, and learning new things. When I'm not coding, you’ll find me with my nose in a book 📚 (Astrophysics, Philosophy and Classic Lit) or drawing nature 🌲 (trees are my best friends 🌳).

## 🌟 **What I Do**

- **Frontend Development**  
  - React.js + TypeScript: Building responsive, dynamic user interfaces.
  - HTML5 + CSS3: Clean, accessible, and beautiful web pages.
  - JavaScript: Making websites come to life with interactions and logic.

- **Backend Development**  
  - Express.js + Node.js: Building RESTful APIs and handling server logic.
  - SQL (SQLite, Knex.js): Crafting and managing databases.

- **Tools & Practices**  
  - Git & GitHub: Version control wizardry.
  - TDD with Vitest: Writing robust, bug-free code through testing.
  - Deployment: Shipping apps to the world using GitHub Pages, Vite, and Dokku.

## 🚧 **Projects In Progress**

### 🕒 [Time Jump](https://github.com/manija-wahab/time-jump) (React & Express.js)
A life-organizer app that breaks down your goals into yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily chunks. Almost ready to launch—just need to add authentication and polish it up!

### 😴 [REM](https://github.com/manija-wahab/rem) (React Native & Express.js)
An app for anyone curious about **lucid dreaming** (because who doesn’t want to control their dreams?). Tracks sleep habits and helps users unlock the mysteries of their subconscious.

### 🖥 [Developer Portfolio](https://github.com/manija-wahab/portfolio) (React & Express.js)
A showcase of my projects and skills! I'm working on adding a **3D twist** with Three.js to make it extra cool. Stay tuned!

## 📚 **Education**
**Dev Academy Aotearoa | Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** (2024)  
Completed an intensive 17-week program focused on building full-stack web applications using modern technologies. Learned how to collaborate in teams, review code, and deliver projects in an Agile environment.

### A Little About Me ✨

Hey there! I’m Noorya, but you can call me Nora (no one ever gets my name right 🤷‍♀️). Coding is my passion, but I also love reading (aiming for 53 books a year!). I also love gaming especially Tekken (Hwoarang is my main but I promise I don't button mash!).

I’m always looking for exciting projects and teams to collaborate with. Let’s create something amazing together!

Feel free to reach out—I’m open to collaboration, learning, and sharing knowledge! 😊
